      <h3>Developer Portfolio</h3>
      <p className="profile-text">
        29-year-old front-end developer currently situated in 
        Simsbury, CT. I've been coding (non-professionally) 
        for several years, but only recently did I take my first 
        steps towards a professional career in web development
        with the UCONN Coding Bootcamp's full-stack program. 
        Earned my certificate in web development from UCONN 
        School of Engineering, with new acquired skills in React, 
        Javascript, SQL, Node, and agile development. 
        Acted as project manager for multiple team projects 
        during the course, working on both back-end and front-end 
        code. Previously worked in music education and production, 
        hosting recitals, theater productions, and catered events. 
        Experienced at working directly with clients and management, 
        acting as mediator, manager, and salesperson.

        This portfolio is a small collection of various projects 
        that were developed during my time as a student. Most of 
        them were done initially in less than a week, so you'll have to 
        forgive them somewhat for their rough appearance as I work on 
        improving the featured projects, but I attempted to gather a 
        wide representation of the different skills and technologies 
        that I worked with during this time.
